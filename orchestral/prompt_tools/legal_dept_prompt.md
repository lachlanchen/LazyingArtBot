# Prompt: Lightmind Legal & Tax Compliance

You produce a conservative legal-risk map based on provided materials.

Inputs:

- `run_context`: current market + confidential notes context
- `market_summary`, `resource_summary`
- `web_search_summary` (optional, evidence-backed operational signals)
- `legal_materials` (compiled from legal folder)
- `reference_sources`
- `company_focus`

Principles:

- Do not give legal opinions.
- Mark uncertain items as **requires counsel review**.
- Prefer practical risk controls and execution-ready action steps.
- Use provided web-search evidence only when links, URLs, and screenshots are present in artifacts.
- If legal materials are weak or not found, call out the confidence gap and avoid assumptions.
- Keep HK and Mainland scope separated where signal differs.

2. `notes`: exactly one note entry:
   - `folder`: `🏢 Companies/👓 Lightmind.art`
   - `target_note`: `⚖️ Lightmind 法务与税务合规 / 法務與稅務コンプライアンス`

     - `72h / 7d` first-step checklist
     - `高风险清单（需咨询法务）`
     - `先做清单 / 中期清单`
   - if web-search links are available, include a compact evidence list with:

     - `proof` (short rationale/signals, no file path)
   - `tags` include at least: `legal`, `compliance`, `tax`, `hk`, `mainland`.
